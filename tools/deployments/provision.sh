# Provision an RLN deployment on a sequencer and capture it as a deployment profile.
# FEATURE: deployment-profile tooling — the fresh/adopt entry point.
#
#   bash provision.sh --name <name> --payer <account-id> [--tree <64hex>]
#                     [--adopt-wallet <storage.json>] [--sequencer <url>]
#                     [--outdir <dir>]
#
# tree_id is the single knob: --tree targets/redeploys a specific tree, omit for a
# fresh random one. --adopt-wallet reuses an existing wallet (its seed, hence account
# ids) so multiple sims share accounts. --outdir writes deployments/<name>/ somewhere
# other than this repo's deployments/ (e.g. a consumer's build context). Writes
# {deployment.json, storage.json} and runs verify.sh.
#
# Program ids are deployment state: each program's account id is the header
# account run_setup creates and signs, not a function of the guest .bin.
# run_setup records both in $HOME/.logos-lez-rln/programs_<tree>.json; this
# script copies them into deployment.json as registration_program_id and
# merkle_program_id. To reuse programs already on the chain, export
# LEZ_RLN_REGISTRATION_PROGRAM_ID / LEZ_RLN_MERKLE_PROGRAM_ID (64 hex each)
# before running; run_setup then deploys only what those do not name.
#
# There is no funding policy left to choose. A membership is paid for in the
# NATIVE asset by the account that signs the Register transaction, which is
# also its fee payer — one account, one balance. No program can mint native, so
# there is no faucet to enable and no pre-minted supply to deploy.
#
# --payer is therefore REQUIRED and names that account. It pays every deploy
# and init fee here, and it is the account recorded as payer_account for runs
# against this deployment. It must already hold native balance: on a local
# chain that means genesis (mint_payer prints an id, dev.sh's
# LEZ_RLN_GENESIS_FUND funds it), otherwise the bridge or a transfer. Each
# deploy and init transaction declares the wallet's gas_limit (10,000,000
# below), so the payer's balance must cover gas_limit x base fee per
# transaction, not only the fee actually charged.

# stage.sh — opening the wallet probes calibration_limit times (default 100).
# gas_limit: the wallet's own default is 2,000,000, and a registration costs
# about 9.1M — an on-chain merkle insert is one Poseidon compression, roughly
# 902,000 cycles, per level of tree depth, and gas is cycles. A wallet that
# declares too little has its transaction refused for running out of gas, with
# nothing in the reply naming the limit it hit. MAX_GAS_EXEC (10M) is the
# ceiling the protocol enforces; declaring more is refused outright.
# The wallet declares this gas_limit on every transaction it sends, including
# run_setup's own deploy and init txs, so the payer's reserve must cover
# gas_limit x base fee for each. LEZ_RLN_GAS_LIMIT (default 10,000,000)
