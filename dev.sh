# --- Patch the shipped debug config ---
# Two edits, both written beside the checkout rather than into it, so a refresh
# of the pinned source never has to reconcile a local change.
#
# 1. Fund a payer at genesis. Public transactions now carry a fee, and the
#    faucet program only runs in the genesis block, so nothing a fresh wallet
#    creates can ever hold native balance. Provisioning therefore mints its
#    payer first and names it here, and the chain starts owing that account a
#    balance. The stock supply accounts in the shipped config belong to whoever
#    generated them, so their keys are no use to us.
#
# 2. Shorten the block interval. The shipped 15s is a testnet cadence; on a
#    devnet it leaves CLOCK_50 — which the registration program reads, and which
#    the clock program refreshes only every 50 blocks — at its genesis zero for
#    over twelve minutes. Registration refuses a zero clock (it would date the
#    membership to 1970 and expire it the moment the clock is first written), so
#    the chain is unusable until then. One second puts CLOCK_50 live inside a
#    minute and shortens every confirmation wait with it.
