//! Shared `Instruction` enums for the RLN registration and merkle programs.
//!
//! Defined once and consumed by both guests (decoded in their plan phase) and
//! the host when building transactions and chained-call payloads.
//!
//! Borsh encodes a variant as its DECLARATION INDEX, so removing or reordering
//! a variant re-numbers every variant after it. A host built against one
//! revision of this enum and a guest built against another agree on the bytes
//! and disagree on their meaning, silently. Move the two together.
//!
//! # Claimed values
//!
//! A program's plan phase sees account ids and authorization flags, never
//! account data. Every value a handler used to read from an account — the
//! clock's timestamp, the config's price and callee program id, a
//! membership's rate limit — therefore travels in the instruction as a CLAIM,
//! and the apply phase that does see the account asserts the claim against
//! the stored bytes. A wrong claim fails the transaction before any chained
//! call runs, so a caller gains nothing by lying: the merkle program id named
//! here is checked against the config account before the merkle program is
//! ever handed `pda_seeds`.
//!
//! The leaf index is NOT a claim. The tree assigns it on insert (its own
//! `next_index`), so registrations built from the same chain state do not
//! contend for one index. Slash and erase carry the index as a HINT that the
//! merkle apply checks by content: the leaf there must be
//! `H(id_commitment, rate_limit)`.
//!
//! A membership is paid for in the NATIVE asset by the account that signs the
//! transaction, which is also its fee payer. There is no payment token, no
//! credit token and no faucet: no program can mint native balance, so it
//! enters an account only at genesis, over the bridge, or by transfer.
