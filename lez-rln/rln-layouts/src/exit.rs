//! Exit codes the guests halt with when a check fails because the CHAIN MOVED
//! between the moment a client read it and the moment its transaction ran.
//!
//! A guest panic is charged the transaction's full declared gas; a guest that
//! halts with a non-zero exit code is charged the cycles it actually ran
//! (`LeeError::ProgramExitedWithCode { code, cycles }`). A client that built
//! an honest transaction from a slightly stale view — the clock ticked, a
//! concurrent registration took the last unit of capacity, someone slashed
//! the member first — therefore pays for the work done, not for the ceiling.
//!
//! Checks that only a malformed or hostile transaction can fail — wrong PDA,
//! wrong account count or shard, a non-field element, a tree or config id that
//! is not the stored one, an init replay — still panic: nothing about the
//! chain can make an honest client trip them, and the full charge is the
//! deterrent.
//!
//! Codes are `u8` because that is what `risc0_zkvm::guest::env::exit` takes;
//! the host sees them widened to `u32`.
